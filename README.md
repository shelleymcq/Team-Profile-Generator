## Description
This app allows a user to create an html page containing information about a group of employees. Using the npm package Inquirer, the user is prompted to enter position, id, email, and other information specific to each employee position. That input is then used to create an html page that can be added to and referenced as needed. The project still requires the added functionality of classes and testing.
